# Adders

I studied some knowledge about various adders during EE577a. And two labs were assigned as practice. Both labs are full custom adder design.
- [Carry Bypass Adder](https://github.com/CWang24/Adders/blob/master/Carry%20Bypass%20Adder.md);
- [64-bit Tree Adder](https://github.com/CWang24/Adders/blob/master/64-bit%20Tree%20Adder.md).
(The reports above are more like a product display while no explantion of the origninal adder knowledge inside. Should I explain something here?)
